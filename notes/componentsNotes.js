// components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, 
// and think about each piece in isolation
/* Components modularize both functionality and presentation in our code.
In order to understand how powerful this consider just how intricate web
applications can become. The difficulty in logically arranging, architecting
, and programming these web applications increases with their size.
Components are like little packages: they help us keep everything organized
and predictable while abstracting the boiler plate code. Each component 
contains a snippet of code that describes what it should render to
the DOM
